								<div class="itemcontent" style="display: none;">
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">AKAR-ERP for accounting
										system has been designed according to the commonly recognized accounting rules
										in the Arab region; where the general ledger account could be affected directly
										by the transactions of sales, purchases, inventory, and also by the journal
										entries resultant from receipt and payment documents. This will allow you to
										have direct queries for the daily transactions, accounting statements, trail
										balances, profit and loss statements and balances sheet. AKAR-ERP also
										supports the function of “Financial analysis” in order to be used optionally,
										the matter which helps accountants to construct the relations of financial
										analysis and indicators of performance evaluation such as “Debt ratios”, ”
										liquidity ratios” , “profitability ratios”, and other ratios of financial
										status. All these ratios provide accurate information for the financial status
										at any moment; where you can create financial analysis relations for the year
										periods or for many years. Financial analysis relations could be also created
										between actual amounts and budget amounts within one year or different years.

									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Comprehensive
											files to define enterprise accounts</strong><br> <strong>AKAR-ERP</strong>
										provides comprehensive files to create the enterprise accounts chart. Via the
										files account categories, accounts chart, account chart type in addition to the
										detail accounts file, you can define the chart of accounts file for each company
										in the companies group; where you can define many types for chart of accounts
										such as commercial chart, manufacturing chart, service chart,…etc. AKAR-ERP
										supports also defining partners in an independent file including the accounts
										related to each partner and consequently; you can monitor the finance for each
										partner and launch the reports for each of them such as the profit ratios, and
										others.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Effective mechanism to cost centers</strong><br>
										While starting to implement AKAR-ERP system, the institutionalized entity is
										defined; where you can define all the companies, all branches in each company,
										departments, sections, in addition to analysis sets. These dimensions could be
										defined as cost centers; consequently, the customer for example in each company
										may have four cost centers. This provides a great flexibility while dealing with
										accounts, cost distribution, and regulatory aspects. This way, you don’t not
										have to define an inventory account for each company, branch or section; rather,
										you can define one inventory account taking into account the defined dimensions
										or cost centers.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Flexible rules for distributing on
											accounts</strong><br> <strong>AKAR-ERP</strong> supports distributing
										values on accounts. In other words, you can affect on many accounts by different
										ratios upon affecting on other accounts. You can distribute these ratios
										manually, or automatically according to SQL queries. For example, the profit
										ratios could be distributed on the company branches according to the total sales
										of each branch. Another example, the salaries of the management employees could
										be distributed on the branches according to the profits of each branch. The
										accounting effect of AKAR-ERP system could be adjusted to be more dynamic and
										intelligent. For example, in some documents, you can affect on the account of
										data entry who logged in the database.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Purchases elements
											and Miscellaneous invoices</strong><br> <strong>AKAR-ERP</strong> supports
										defining purchases elements such as petty cash, workers tips, buffet
										requirements. These expenses are bought via miscellaneous invoice and let
										AKAR-ERP system to affect on the desired accounts automatically rather than
										having to create journal entries that require accounting experience.<br>
										&nbsp;<br> <strong>Flexibility for defining budgets</strong><br>
										<strong>AKAR-ERP</strong> provides a special menu for budgets. You can define
										a scenario of planned budget for purchases account, salaries account, or any
										other account whether per year or per month. You can define the account budget
										for a certain cost center or many cost centers. You can also adjust the system
										such that the account value does not AKAR its budget. For example, You can
										prevent user from issuing purchases invoices that AKAR the purchases budget
										within a specific period.<br> <strong>AKAR-ERP</strong> also provides defining
										a budget (forecast) for items of the sales either for a specific item or a group
										of items (such as drugs or chemicals). You can define many scenarios per
										customer or salesman to record the expected sales amount for each item (or a
										group of items) at the level of a specific period or any of defined cost centers
										such as department, section. AKAR-ERP provides a mechanism to calculate the
										cost of the budget items, and then the expected profit.<br> &nbsp;<br>
										<strong>Comprehensive documentary cycle</strong><br> <strong>AKAR-ERP</strong>
										provides all required accounting documents, where you can affect on the accounts
										and subsidiaries via the journal entries. You can also pay the due debt of
										vendors and customers via payment and receipt vouchers. AKAR-ERP provides also
										requests documents to issue payment and receipt vouchers based on them in
										addition to debit and credit notes.<br> Full support for foreign currencies<br>
										You can define any number of currencies in addition to have the capability to
										change the exchange rate yearly, monthly or daily. You can also enter the
										exchange rate manually in AKAR-ERP documents such as sales invoices, purchases
										invoices, receipt vouchers and payment vouchers.<br> &nbsp;<br> <strong>Full
											integration with the other AKAR-ERP systems</strong><br> Accounts
										documents integrate with the other AKAR-ERP documents. For example, you can
										pay the sales invoices via receipt vouchers, and purchases invoices via payment
										vouchers. AKAR-ERP allows paying the invoices either according to debt age
										arrangement, or by selecting specific invoices to be paid. Accounts documents
										integrate also with the Banks system; where, you can pay payment and receipt
										vouchers via commercial papers (cheques or bills of exchange).<br> &nbsp;<br>

										reconciliation system supported by AKAR-ERP to compare between the enterprise
										statement, and bank statement; AKAR-ERP also supports a reconciliation system
										for any subsidiary account (customer/vendor/employees. And so on). Via
										subsidiary reconciliation document, you can compare between the enterprise
										transactions of a customer, for example and the transactions sent from this

								<div class="itemcontent" style="display: none;">
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">Fixed assets are
										characterized by a special nature as they have a tangible physical entity, and
										they are acquired for use not for sale, and also the useful life for fixed
										assets remains for years and their values should be reduced periodically in
										order to reflect the current values. AKAR-ERP supports all fixed asset phases
										including purchasing, periodic depreciation, transferring, replacement,
										maintaining, and disposal.<br> AKAR-ERP supports dealing with some assets as
										custodies with employees in addition to monitoring them via comprehensive
										documents cycle.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Comprehensive
											file for each asset</strong><br> AKAR-ERP supports a comprehensive file
										for each asset including its serial number, location, insurance information,
										custody, warranty terms, in addition to a large number of accounts including the
										asset account, depreciation account, and accumulative depreciation account. Via
										this file, AKAR-ERP also, displays instantaneous information for the asset
										according to its documents such as purchasing value, production date, the
										current status of its depreciation, the information of the asset as a custody
										with full statement for the assigned employees from the acquisition to the
										disposal of assets, and statistical data for the asset such as useful life,
										remaining life, and the date of last depreciation. AKAR-ERP also supports
										attaching infinite number of attachments for the asset such as the Certificate
										of warranty, contract of purchase, and any number of asset pictures and remarks
										.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Organizational
											environment for assets</strong><br> While implementing AKAR-ERP system,
										the organization of the entity is defined including the companies, branches,
										sectors, departments, and analysis sets. User can define these regulatory titles
										as cost centers; consequently, each asset in the company may has four cost
										centers. This concept provides great flexibility for assets accounts and
										regulatory issues. This way, user does not have to define building account to
										each branch, sector, department. Rather, one building account could be defined
										and affected taking into account the different cost centers. In addition to the
										regulatory environment; AKAR-ERP supports a comprehensive file for the fixed
										assets types such as cars, machines, equipments. And so on, as well as another
										file allocated to fixed assets locations. This close-knit regulatory environment
										gives a great flexibility for transferring assets and custodies and launching
										fixed assets reports using existing regulatory parameters.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Full integration
											with the other AKAR-ERP systems</strong><br> Fixed assets integrate with
										account system. For example, the system allows defining many accounts for each
										asset including asset account, depreciation account, and accumulative
										depreciation account. As another example fixed assets system integrates with
										human resources as user can define the asset as a custody with any of the
										company employees.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Simulation for

										following procedures:<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Purchasing
											assets</strong><br> AKAR-ERP supports the purchasing cycle for fixed
										assets via some documents related to fixed assets such as “Fixed Asset Purchase
										invoice”, “Fixed Asset Purchase Request”, and “Fixed Asset Purchase Order”. Via
										the purchase invoice, you can buy an asset or a group of assets taking into
										account the commonly recognized purchasing principles such as supplier name,
										purchases man, currency, asset value, the information of shipping and billing,
										in addition to information related to the fixed asset system such as useful
										life, salvage value, and the location of the asset.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Recording
											existing fixed assets </strong><br> When transforming from manual work or
										other systems to AKAR-ERP, you can record an existing fixed asset via a fixed
										asset opening document including all fixed asset information such as
										“Depreciation start date”, “useful life”, “salvage value”,..etc. After recording
										the opening information of the fixed assets, AKAR-ERP monitors all fixed
										assets transactions such as depreciation, transferring, maintenance, and
										disposal.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Transferring
											assets between the entity locations</strong><br> AKAR-ERP supports
										transferring fixed assets between different locations at the level of companies,
										branches, sectors, and departments in order to closing the expenses of the fixed
										asset in the first location and posting the remaining value of the asset; and
										consequently, the depreciation effect to the accounts of the other location. The
										regulatory environment provided by AKAR-ERP supports transferring the fixed
										assets efficiently, where you can keep the fixed asset account with changing the
										cost centers (such as company, branch, department, sector, and analysis set).

									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Effective and
											powerful system for costing:</strong></p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">Before implementing
										AKAR-ERP system, you can choose the costing method to be applied. AKAR-ERP
										implementers will guide you how to apply this method.<br> AKAR-ERP developers
										paid a great attention to costing process as it indicates how much profit or
										loss specially in manufacturing activities. You can adjust the average cost so
										as to be at the level of company, warehouse, location, department and section.
										The cost may be also at the level of item type such as batch no, size, version,
										and color in order to have an average cost for each item type. You can also
										generate “Additional receipt cost” documents to charge the item cost by any
										additional cost such as shipment cost, customs, taxes, or any additional
										expenses. These additional cost could be distributed manually or according to
										weight, quantity, ..etc. The cost of the free item could be defined by any
										costing way according to the enterprise’s perspective.<br> AKAR-ERP system
										does not wait for posting documents in order to calculate the items cost, as you
										don’t have to post documents with AKAR-ERP; rather, the cost are calculated
										upon saving documents. AKAR-ERP also recalculates the items costs upon
										modifying or deleting any old documents or even adding document by previous
										dates taking into account the documents arrangement and its affect on the
										average cost.<br> Furthermore, AKAR-ERP has variant methods to charge each
										item by the real cost; where you can generate Re-evaluate documents to change
										the item cost for any reason. AKAR-ERP also affects on the item cost upon
										changing the discounts of previous invoices and consequently re-evaluates the
										invoices discounts in order to automatically change items costs to reflect the
										new discounts.</p>

										calculates the differences between the actual quantities and the accounting
										quantities to generate the stock receipt, stock issue and accounting entry
										vouchers required to adjust the warehouses quantities. AKAR-ERP also simulates
										the actual conditions for stocktaking; where usually, users discover that there
										are some missing documents before stocktaking procedures, or there documents
										that have incorrect data that will have a great effect in the inventory value.
										In these cases, you can create missing documents or modify incorrect documents
										and attach these changes to the ended stocktaking; consequently, affect on the
										inventory accounts, and quantities rather than having to re-perform all
										stocktaking procedures and suspend users again.</p>

										also modifying discounts of the vendors and charge the vendor by the difference
										of previous and new discounts which is named as post discount which recalculates
										the inventory cost to reflect the applied discounts. This is a very strong
										point; where some vendors request from their customers/distributers to magnify
										the discount of their goods in order to get rid of some items either for the
										approaching of expiry date or to offer new goods, or any other reasons. This
										feature also supports the annual target for vendors to reach to specific volume

									Credits</h3>
								<div class="itemcontent" style="display: none;">
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;">The import process and
										Letter of credits have a special nature, where the letter of credit may be
										received on many shipments, and within several periods; therefore, Letter of
										credit system requires a strong and effective system in order to monitoring the
										cost of shipments including the expenses paid by the company until closing the
										letter of credit and costing all imported items. At the same time, the system
										should allow selling the imported items before reaching to the final cost.
										AKAR-ERP system covers all letter of credit procedures such as Letter of
										credit opening requests, issuing a Performa Invoice, monitoring all imported
										shipments and expenses spent in details, in addition to closing the letter of
										credit and preventing users from issuing transactions for it.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Comprehensive
											data For letter of credit and expenses items</strong><br> AKAR-ERP allows
										recording all letter of credit information including bank info, correspondent
										bank, vendor, account currency, shipment data, delivery, insurance, customs,
										letter of credit types and accounts, in addition to the items of planned
										shipments, and the delivery date for each of them. AKAR-ERP also allows to
										define infinite number of costing methods in order to distribute the letter of
										credit cost on the items by any way such as by value, weight, quantity, or by
										manual distributing.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Supporting for
											all letter of credits types</strong><br> AKAR-ERP supports all types of
										letter credits types such as confirmed and not confirmed letter of credit, fully
										and partially recovered, promoted,..and so on. AKAR-ERP also supports all
										shipments policies, opening the letter of credit by any currency, and receiving
										any number of shipments. Furthermore, Letter of credit value could be reduced or
										increased.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Full coverage for
											letter of credit procedures </strong><br> AKAR-ERP supports all documents
										required to perform all letter of credit procedures such as LC opening request
										in order to open a letter of credit in the bank, Performa invoice that contains
										the letter of credit items at the beginning of the contract. Via this Performa
										invoice, user can enter the purchased items, their quantities, prices,
										specifications, ..and so on. Through this invoice, you can also define the
										payment method and the details of payments to be paid to the vendor. Through the
										expense document, you can record all expenses of the letter of credit in order
										to be distributed on the purchased items. Via LC cost documents, AKAR-ERP
										collects the stock receipt documents and expense documents for each LC shipment
										in order to calculate the final cost for each item according to the item
										quantity, expenses, and the distribution method<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Full tracking for
											letter of credit procedures</strong><br> AKAR-ERP supports all procedures
										of the letter of credit via a special file named LC action; where you can record
										the arrival of the insurance policy, shipment policy, promote actions, Customs
										Clearance, or even cancelling the letter of credit. Through recording of these
										procedures, you can launch all reports to recognize the letter of credit status
										and all its details with the vendors or any official party.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Monitor the
											letter of credit Instantaneously</strong><br> As soon as issuing the LC cost
										document, AKAR-ERP costs the items of the letter of credit and close it so as
										to prevent adding any additional costs. But waiting till receiving all shipments
										and recording all expenses in order to calculate the final cost seems illogical;
										especially the enterprise needs to sell the received goods and determines the
										prices according to the final cost; therefore, AKAR-ERP provides a mechanism
										to cost the received shipments instantaneously according to stock receipt and
										expenses documents. This technique allows user to have online information for
										the items costs according to received items and spent expenses.<br> &nbsp;</p>
									<p class="wow fadeInUp animated"
										style="visibility: visible; animation-name: fadeInUp;"><strong>Reverse expenses
											to reduce costs</strong><br> The vendor sometimes returns some of goods
										value because of the lack of required quantity, or non-compliance of the agreed
										specifications. In these cases, you can record an expense for this cost but by a
										negative value; therefore, the vendor will be credit rather than debit.
										Recording a negative value for the cost allows the enterprise to get any
										expenses back from the vendor. This is a good way rather than issuing adjustment
										entries or modifying the letter of credit data which consequently changes the
										financial statements.<br> &nbsp;</p>
